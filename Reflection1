   <h1> This is my first reflection </h1>
   <h2> How exciting </h2>
</body> In Platos Cave by Susan Sontang from On Photography, 1977 argues that photography changes how we experience reality, turning the world into a collection of images that shape our understanding and ethics of seeing. Sontang spoke on how photographers capture and fame moments and altar perceptions of the world, making it more manageable and familiar. </p>
<p> Sontang notes that, photographing is essentially an act of non‑intervention were the 

 photographer observes rather than participates but still the act of photographing is more than  

passive observing. She says photos make us feel like we’re “collecting” the world, but this can  

create distance rather than true understanding. This detachment creates a sense of pseudo- 

presence, where the image represents reality without truly capturing it. As she puts it, "A 

 photograph is both a pseudo-presence and a token of absence." photographs especially those of 

people, of distant landscapes and faraway cities, of the vanished past are incitements to reverie. </p>
<p> Photographs evoke a range of emotions and desires, often fueled by the unattainable.  

Desire has no history at least; it is experienced in each instance as all foreground, immediacy. 

Sontag observes that the sense of distance evoked by photographs can enhance desirability,  

tapping into erotic feelings and sentimental attachments. The sense of the unattainable that 

can be evoked by photographs feeds directly into the erotic feelings of those for whom  

desirability is enhanced by distance. </p>

<p> Sontag's point also critiques the impact of photography on our perception of suffering and injustice. The vast catalogue of misery and atrocity has made the horrible seem ordinary, familiar, and inevitable. By making the world more available through images, photography can desensitize us to reality, creating a sense of detachment rather than engagement. </p>
<p> Ultimately, Sontag argues that photography shapes our understanding of the world, influencing what we notice and value. While photographs can evoke powerful emotions and connections, they also risk making the world seem more accessible than it truly is, leading to a superficial understanding of reality. Today everything exists to end in a photograph.</p>
